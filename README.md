# Valentine Invitation ðŸ’˜

A simple Valentine invitation inspired by viral TikToks. This project is a fun way to send a virtual Valentine, with a little twist!

## How it works 

This is a very simple interactive app where users can make a choice:

- **Hovering or clicking on the "NO" button**: The button moves around the screen.
- **Choosing "YES"**: Both the GIF and buttons disappear, and a special Valentine's GIF will appear as a surprise.
